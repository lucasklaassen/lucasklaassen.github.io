<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<div class="content-body">
<strong>Scaling "Pockets of Excellence"</strong> Super.com had smart engineers and robust tools, but adoption was uneven. While "power users" leveraged AI for high-level planning and execution, other teams relied solely on basic tab completion. This competency gap created a massive opportunity for education, but the organization lacked a unified engine to drive it.

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<div class="content-body">
<strong>The AI Enablement Sprint</strong> We didn't need to rebuild the stack; we needed to distribute the best practices that already existed in silos. We executed a 5-week "Enablement Sprint" focused on education, tooling awareness, and process standardization.
</div>

<ul class="bullet-list">
<li><strong>"Keeping Agents On a Leash"</strong>: We shifted the mental model from "Author" to "Architect & Reviewer". We taught engineers to avoid "Lazy Velocity" by applying a strict workflow: providing the AI with clear intent and constraints (the leash) while retaining full responsibility for verification and system design.</li>
<li><strong>18 Mob Programming Sessions</strong>: We moved beyond theory, gathering teams to fix real bugs live. These sessions showcased how to “Keep Agents On A Leash” and utilize MCP integrations (Datadog, Jira) to give the Agent context.</li>
<li><strong>Rule Lifecycle Governance</strong>: We empowered all teams with a clear protocol for when to create, update, and promote rules. This transformed "hidden" personal rules into shared global assets strengthened by an AI Guild review board.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Hiring</strong>: Established the technical standards and evaluation criteria for the permanent AI Lead role.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Results</h2>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<ul class="checkmark-list">
<li><strong>244% Increase in Adoption</strong>: Average total usage of the AI Coding Agent increased by 244%, proving a massive shift from "Tab Complete" to "Agentic Workflow".</li>
<li><strong>Standardized Governance</strong>: Established the "Rule Lifecycle" process, empowering the AI Guild to effectively govern and share context across teams.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<ul class="checkmark-list">
<li><strong>Unlocked Tooling ROI</strong>: Increased adoption of MCP & DevEx tools, ensuring engineers are finally utilizing the robust infrastructure the platform team has already built.</li>
