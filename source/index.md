I've spent over 11 years as a software developer and architect, progressing from a full-stack developer to Lead Architect at Thinkific. I've set technical strategy, led teams through complex migrations, and architected and shipped company-wide AI initiatives from the ground up.

Today, I consult with companies to solve technical challenges—from architectural strategy to hands-on AI integration. I keep my skills sharp by building my passion project MMA Fantasy, a full-stack mobile app with 2,000+ monthly active users.

I can deliver the most value if your problem fits one of the following:

1. **Performance.** You bring me your slow app or struggling database. I diagnose the bottleneck, deliver an actionable plan, and either guide your team through the fix or implement it. 

2. **AI Integration.** You want to add LLMs to your product or adopt AI tooling. I architect and build the system (RAG pipelines, chatbots, AI agents) and train your team on best practices. 

3. **Technical Debt Audit.** You have a backlog of tech debt and don't know what to tackle first. I implement observability, identify weak points, and deliver a prioritized roadmap that balances tech debt with product goals. 

4. **AWS Optimization.** Your AWS bill is climbing or you suspect inefficiency. I audit your setup, optimize costs, and help migrate to components that make sense for your scale. 

5. **Developer Experience.** Your engineers are slowed down by tooling or workflows. I identify friction points and build solutions—load testing infrastructure, CLI tools, testing strategies. 

6. **Prototype.** You have a problem or feature idea nobody has time for. I build an end-to-end production-ready prototype your team can run with. 

**Work with an architect who can both code and lead.**

Next step is to email [hello@lucasklaassen.com](mailto:hello@lucasklaassen.com) and tell me which problems you're dealing with, and we'll set up an intro call.

I'm comfortable at all layers of the stack: from API backends to SPA frontends, Cloud infrastructure, and AI integrations.

> Lucas joined us as a consultant at a pivotal moment, and his expertise was a game-changer for our engineering organization. I personally learned a lot from him regarding AI Governance, and our sessions were incredibly productive. It was a great opportunity to cross-reference our internal practices with the high-level AI development workflows he has implemented with his own teams. His consultancy work was instrumental in helping us scale AI usage internally, empowering a significant portion of our engineering team to master and adopt these new processes effectively. Lucas is a brilliant strategic partner who knows exactly how to translate complex AI concepts into scalable engineering results. I highly recommend his services to any organization looking to level up their AI capabilities.
