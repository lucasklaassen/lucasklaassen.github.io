**I help engineering leaders move past the "Chatbot Prototype" phase to build secure, governed, and production-ready AI infrastructure.**

I’ve spent over 11 years as a software developer and architect, progressing from a full-stack developer to Lead Architect at Thinkific. Today, I specialize in the intersection of traditional software architecture and modern AI integration. I don’t just "add an LLM." I architect the systems, governance, and workflows that make AI a scalable part of your business.

I keep my skills sharp by building my passion project **MMA Fantasy**, a full-stack mobile app with 2,000+ monthly active users, where I dogfood the latest in AI-native development.

I deliver the most value when helping organizations solve these specific AI challenges:

1. **AI-Native Engineering Operations.** AI is a force multiplier for your team, but only if they know how to use it. I lead "Enablement Sprints", using mob programming to fix real bugs live, to bridge the competency gap and unlock the ROI of your existing infrastructure and MCP integrations. In a [recent 5-week engagement with Super.com](/case-studies/super-com/), this approach drove a [244% increase in agentic workflow adoption](/case-studies/super-com/) across an 80+ person engineering org.

2. **RAG & Agentic Workflows.** You want to move beyond "basic tab completion" to sophisticated AI features. I architect production-ready RAG pipelines and teach teams to shift their mental model from "Author" to "Architect & Reviewer," ensuring agents stay "on a leash" while delivering high-intent results.

3. **AI Strategy & Governance.** You need to move from fragmented experiments to a cohesive strategy. I help you implement governance frameworks, such as the "Rule Lifecycle" protocol, that ensure security and reliability.

4. **Holistic AI Architecture (The Foundation).** AI requires a rock-solid foundation. I leverage my background in **AWS Optimization and Performance Tuning** to ensure your AI infrastructure is cost-efficient and performant. I also provide specialized support for **Technical Hiring**, helping you vet and secure permanent AI leadership in record time.

**Work with an architect who can both set the strategy and write the code.**

Next step is to email [hello@lucasklaassen.com](mailto:hello@lucasklaassen.com). Tell me about your current AI roadmap or the architectural bottlenecks slowing you down, and we'll set up an intro call.
