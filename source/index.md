**I help teams adopt AI in reliable, practical ways that increase their daily output—whether that's developers writing better code or back-office teams automating manual work.**

Most companies struggle to move AI from experimentation to reliable daily use. I solve this by embedding with teams across your organization to build and deploy AI workflows that actually enhance productivity.

I've spent over 11 years as a software developer and architect, progressing from a full-stack developer to Lead Architect at Thinkific. I keep my skills sharp by building **MMA Fantasy**, a full-stack mobile app with 2,000+ monthly active users, where I dogfood the latest in AI-native development.

## How I Work

I don't just consult and leave. I embed with your teams to:

1. **Train engineers on AI-assisted development.** I run hands-on enablement sprints using mob programming to fix real bugs live. In a [recent 5-week engagement with Super.com](/case-studies/super-com/), this approach drove a [244% increase in agentic workflow adoption](/case-studies/super-com/) across an 80+ person engineering org.

2. **Map manual processes across departments.** I meet with Sales, Finance, HR, Marketing, and Support teams to identify repetitive tasks that can be automated.

3. **Build and deploy automation agents.** I create roadmaps for each department, then work alongside teams to build, deploy, and refine agents that solve real problems.

4. **Iterate until the AI is genuinely useful.** I stay involved through deployment and iteration cycles to ensure the AI enhances workflows rather than creating new friction.

## Projects I Take On

**Company-wide AI enablement for engineering teams.** Elevate your developers' capabilities through structured training and hands-on practice with AI-assisted coding tools.

**Department-by-department automation roadmaps + agent development.** From identifying opportunities to deploying production agents, I work across your organization to automate back-office processes.

**End-to-end AI architecture.** When you need production-ready RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, or AI infrastructure, I architect and build the systems—ensuring they're reliable, secure, and maintainable.

## Who I Work With

I work with **tech companies** looking to accelerate their teams' AI adoption and **traditional businesses** seeking to automate manual processes across their organizations. 

Whether you're a CTO wanting your engineering team to leverage AI better, or a COO looking to automate repetitive work across departments, I bring both strategic vision and hands-on execution.

**Work with an architect who can both set the strategy and write the code.**
