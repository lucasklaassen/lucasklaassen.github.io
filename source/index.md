I've spent over 11 years as a software developer and architect, progressing from a full-stack developer to Lead Architect at Thinkific. I've set technical strategy, led teams through complex migrations, and architected and shipped company-wide AI initiatives from the ground up.

Today, I consult with companies to solve technical challenges—from architectural strategy to hands-on AI integration. I keep my skills sharp by building my passion project MMA Fantasy, a full-stack mobile app with 2,000+ monthly active users.

I can deliver the most value if your problem fits one of the following:

1. **Performance.** You bring me your slow app or struggling database. I diagnose the bottleneck, deliver an actionable plan, and either guide your team through the fix or implement it. 

2. **AI Integration.** You want to add LLMs to your product or adopt AI tooling. I architect and build the system (RAG pipelines, chatbots, AI agents) and train your team on best practices. 

3. **Technical Debt Audit.** You have a backlog of tech debt and don't know what to tackle first. I implement observability, identify weak points, and deliver a prioritized roadmap that balances tech debt with product goals. 

4. **AWS Optimization.** Your AWS bill is climbing or you suspect inefficiency. I audit your setup, optimize costs, and help migrate to components that make sense for your scale. 

5. **Developer Experience.** Your engineers are slowed down by tooling or workflows. I identify friction points and build solutions—load testing infrastructure, CLI tools, testing strategies. 

6. **Prototype.** You have a problem or feature idea nobody has time for. I build an end-to-end production-ready prototype your team can run with. 

**Work with an architect who can both code and lead.**

Next step is to email [lucasklaassen1@gmail.com](mailto:lucasklaassen1@gmail.com) and tell me which problems you're dealing with, and we'll set up an intro call.

I'm comfortable at all layers of the stack: from API backends to SPA frontends, Cloud infrastructure, and AI integrations.

## Examples

**Performance for Thinkific:** Improved customer search endpoint from 160s to 350ms (99.7% improvement) by diagnosing the bottleneck and migrating to Elasticsearch.

**Performance for MBRU:** Course with 800,000+ enrollments couldn't load progress reports. Diagnosed expensive SQL queries, added strategic indexes, enabled report viewing and export.

**AI Integration for Thinkific:** Architected company-wide AI service for RAG, learning assistant chatbot with evals, and Gen AI features across multiple teams.

**AI Education for Thinkific:** Trained entire engineering organization on AI-assisted coding with Cursor AI, achieving 4/5 star rating and measurable adoption.

**Observability for Thinkific:** Set up monitoring dashboard to track 502 errors, identified root cause within first month, reduced errors to zero. Became the "New Relic master" finding sore spots across all systems.

**Technical Debt Prioritization for Thinkific:** Created database audit identifying short and long-term risks. Set technical strategy and roadmap that led to completion of 4+ years of accumulated technical debt migrations.

**AWS Optimization for Thinkific:** Reduced Redis cluster CPU from 100% to 3% and cut cache refresh times from minutes to milliseconds, dramatically reducing infrastructure costs and improving reliability.

**Developer Experience for Thinkific:** Built load testing scripts for critical user journeys and monitoring tools to visualize results. Created CLI tool for generating branch names from JIRA tickets across multiple repos. Led Frontend Guild initiatives for React Hooks testing and TypeScript adoption.

**MMA Fantasy:** Built full-stack fantasy sports platform (React Native, Node.js, PostgreSQL) from scratch with 2,000+ monthly active users. Real-time chat, localization, LLM research insights.
